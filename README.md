# Loki DB

Loki Database library is a project for hobby purposes. Target ist to create a RDBMS with own storage engine and standard features like realtions, data typing, transactions and so on. It's in an early state and not for use in real life projects. 

# Please note that ...
... in the actual state of development, there are many missing features. At the time of writing this text, even main functionality like DELETE statements and indexing in tables.
